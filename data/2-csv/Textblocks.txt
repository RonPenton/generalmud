health to you.  Though my appearance belies it, I once was a QUESTER such as
yourself.  I met my match in a hellishly perplexing LABYRINTH, just to the 
north of here...  the BEASTS inside took me apart, as you can see, and nearly
took my life.""

you move about, passages shift, and occasionally you find yourself... 
elsewhere.  Secret passages are rife throughout the place, and are necessary
to its completion, I believe.  Some are activated by statues, or riddles, or
simply by finding a hidden button or catch lurking on a wall.  I do not 
remember any specific DETAILS, these long years have worn down my memory...
but if you find anything, come to me and I will attempt to aid you in your
search.  I crawled out of there years ago, mortally wounded and rent limb   
from limb.  My last wish as I felt myself dying was to find a safe and 
tranquil place to breathe my last breath.  I pulled myself into this hole, 
and finding it deserted, prepared myself to die.  But there is something
strange about this small cave, something holy, as if it is a place sacred to 
the gods.  There is some power which has kept me alive these years, and 
though I am scarred and crippled my life was saved.  I have devoted the rest 
of my life to creating a sacred SHRINE here.""

13,0,0,"The crippled adventurer says ""Since the gods spared my meager life, and have
taught me humility, I have dedicated the rest of my life to creating a shrine
for this holy place.  They provide me with nourishment, and prevent any
creature from harming me.  In return, I pray hourly to their great wisdom and
compassion, and I carve images on these walls to illustrate their glory.
Though I have but one arm, and a single eye, I once fancied myself a decent
stonesmith and am putting to use my last remaining gift in creating these
carvings.  Progress is slow, and tedious, but it is now my life's work and I
am very much dedicated to it.  Not that I would be suited for anything else.
You can see one image that I have finished upon the wall there.  It is rough,
but it is my first, and I am sure I will improve with time.  Time is all I
have.""

concentration on his face.  Suddenly he exclaims ""NOW I remember... there are
symbols there, which you must manipulate in the correct order to open a 
concealed passageway... a sun, moon, and star, am I correct?  Let's see...
first of all, you must twist the sun symbol...""  He pauses again, this time
with a look of confusion.  ""You must twist the sun symbol... but I cannot 
remember which way.  The memory has indeed faded...  The only other thing I
can recall is that the star is the last thing which you must manipulate.""

may even give you a special price.""  He grins and strokes his beard over that 
last statement.
Ƚ'7532"
19,0,0,"""Yes, axes. None of these swords or bows that the you usually see in the
Realm. No wonder the orcs are taking over, they have nothing to be frightened
about. But if old Thuluk went out and chopped a few up with his 'Cleaver', 
I'm sure these orcs would think twice about messing with Silvermere. I mean,
can a sword cut down a tree? You need an axe to get the job done, and an orc
cut in two is a job done right."" From the way this guy talks about himself in
third person, you realize that it probably wouldn't be a good idea to cross
him. Maybe an axe is a good choice in weaponry, even if it is just to please
old Thuluk.

secret I did not know, when it appeared from around a corner!  All five of 
them fought valiantly, but apparently their attacks had no effect, as both
sword blows and magical fire did not slow it down.  It consumed them all,

prison of the Archmage Dhelvanen. And prison it is, although its appearance
says otherwise... I cannot leave these chambers. Despite all the powers at my
command, I am trapped here, helpless."" He clenches his fist, and furrows his
brow in frustration. Letting out a small sigh, he continues, ""A long while
ago, when I was younger and more foolish, I felt my power was so great that I
could accomplish anything. However, this was not enough. My lust for power
was so great, my obsession so powerful, that my every waking moment was spent
in the search for even greater power. In my travels I discovered an ancient
document revealing a method to increasing the strength of my spells by
enough to make me so incredibly strong in the arts of magic that an entire
army would wither before my assault. Visons of glory and mastery of lands
passed through my mind, and immediately I set out to find the material
components needed in the ritual. The main component was the scale of a
powerful, aged dragon."" He coughs slightly, and shakes his head as if coming
out of a dream. He looks you over, saying, ""I am sorry, I tend to ramble on,
having company so incredibly rarely has corroded my social skills. If you
wish me to continue, ask me about the DRAGON. Also, new information I have
found by scrying other worlds has given me HOPE of escaping my prison here.
I would ask your help if you are willing to give it.""

powerful. Compared to her, I was a child. What dragon you may ask? Well, my
travels through the lands led me to these very caverns. Having researched
various rumours concerning the whereabouts of powerful dragons, and having
conducted arcane searches, I found that one old she-dragon laired deep within
these caves, far to the east, in a lava flow. Upon finding her lair, I cast a
powerful spell of concealing, and slipped by her deadly brood unnoticed. As I
entered the vast cavern within which she dwelled, I found her waiting for me.
What incredible stupidity to have thought I was a match for her. She saw
through my spell as if it were nothing more than a feeble child's cantrip. In
desperation I threw bolts of energy, to distract or wound her, but she
shrugged them off. With one gutteral word she froze me in my tracks, and then
proceeded to devise ways to make me pay for my arrogance, telling me these in
an amused tone."" He pauses a moment, and then continues, ""Well, to make a
long story short, she created these chambers, let me take some things from my
home, and then sealed them off from normal space with her magics. I am unable
to leave these rooms. I do not age while I am here, nor can I die. My only
comforts are in my books, weaving tapestries, scrying the outside world with
my powers, and devising some method of revenge."" He eyes you up and down, and
says, ""In fact... perhaps you could be of some HELP with the dragon.""

for revenge. If there is some way you could bring about the demise of that
cruel she-dragon, I would reward you with a powerful artifact of magic. Of
course, to slay her you would need a large party of extremely powerful
adventurers, no single person could possible hope to survive. Also, I could
reward you for fetching a few lesser things for me... for some of my more
powerful scrying techniques, I need the eye of a cyclops. And in for some of
the more delicate weavings I make, spider silk is invaluable. For either of
these things I would give you a lesser magic item. Good luck in your travels,
adventurer."" He thinks for a second, and then says, ""Oh yes... you will need
some sort of protection to survive in the extreme heat of the lava flow... if
you bring me the hide of a greater hellhound, i will be able to fashion an
amulet that will let you survive the temperature. Note that it will NOT
protect you from actual damage! But it WILL let you pass through the lava
area.""

He possesses powerful magics, and is the principal spell-caster and councelor

dangerous of the three lieutenants. The second key is held by Kor, one of the
Chosen of the Blood Lord. He is a brute, very stupid, but is extremely
powerful and has an animal-like cunning. His divine favour allows him powers
beyond the range of normal beings. The third and last key is in the
possession of Mailana, a dark-elf assassin of great skill. She is a master of

skill are unmatched by any in the citadel, and even the Champion is wary of
her. All three are dangerous opponents, and should not be tampered with

the iron fence surrounding the house is bent and rusty, it is 
still quite functional and would prevent entry. The mansion's
once-expansive garden is now wholly overgrown with creeping
weeds, but from this height you can make out the square shape
of a large grate set in the broken ground. A well-used path

""...the Great War. Most of the cities were razed to the ground
by Hellfire, their citizens slaughtered or driven into the 
surrounding countryside, forced to live in fearful squalor 
while the armies of the Dark One continued their destruction.
The places the least affected by the War were the isolated 
cities-- Daerlon, Silvermere, Goldhome, and the like, as the
Dark One concentrated his attacks upon the centers of strength
from the outset, and even by the time the dark forces were 
finally repelled, they had not yet reached them. The forests of
the Elves escaped wrath, of course, as their obscuring magics
prevented the enemy from penetrating far into the wood. The
Dwarves had but to shut their impenetrable iron doors and let
the tides of Orcs pound themselves senseless against them. The
Kang simply stayed in their swamps, as any evil force who 
entered had not only to battle the hostile swamp, but the
clever guerilla tactics of the Kang warriors. The other races,
however, suffered greatly, their numbers decimated by the 
ruthless and ceaseless assaults of the dark tide...""

[0mWith a snap of his fingers, Balthazar summons a glittering black ring forth from the ether. It floats over to the still-spinning shrunken skull, and they merge to form a ring! With a small wave of his hand, the eyes in the skull begin to burn with an unholy red light. The ring then floats over to you, and you take it gingerly in your hand.[s

  Markus.  You have proved to have some small worth, after all.  And your

[37mBalthazar stands, and makes a slow circle with his upturned palm.

[31mA shimmering red portal snaps into existance in front of you!

[37mThrough the portal, you can see a mysterious wood, its trees bearing an almost
metallic bark, its leaves shimmering in the dim light. 

With a sudden gesture, Balthazar dispels the portal, and continues:

[0;32m""The accursed forest I have just shown you is home to a breed of especially
  offensive wood-elves, and exists to the northwest of Silvermere, across the
  river of its namesake.  They inhabit the tops of the trees, and, like vermin,
  pour forth in numbers when the occasion suits them, and when on unfamiliar
  ground, they flee in cowardice.  The elf-lord in their ""city"" has recently
  desecrated a temple dear to me, and punishment for this is a grisly death.
  I want you to slay this unholy elf and bring me his head-- as well as at 
  least ten of his fellow elves' heads. Go now, and do not [0;1;32mreturn[0;1;32m

bright flame.  Shaking the ashes off of his palm, he growls:

  pleased with your efforts if I had not received this accursed note.  Perhaps
  it would be best to show you.""

[0mWith an angry wave, the swirling red portal appears once more, this time
revealing what appears to be a small army of brutish, hulking figures encamped
outside of a ruined city.  Taller, better equipped figures walk amongst them,
and occasionally you can see the flash of magic.

 [0;32m""It appears that the ogre-mage Goru-Nezar, as former underling of mine, has
  decided to strike out on his own.  If he were simply deserting me, I would
  just have him slain, but he has gathered a small force and is searching for
  something in the ruined city of Cirgathil.  His pathetic army is of no worry
  to me, but for some reason I cannot scry into that forsaken ruin.  There is
  some forgotten power within, which I believe he seeks-- so he can usurp my
  domination.  I charge you to seek out the ogre-mage lord, and return me his
  filthy head, so that I may animate it and keep it as a reminder to all who
  would oppose me.  The reward shall be great if you do as I command.  The only

""King Yeshuz is mad.  I stand here writing what may be my last testament to
 the horrible crimes being commited outside, in hopes that anyone finding this
 may learn from the deadly curse our mad king has brought upon us.  Our King 
 was not always an evil man, and never a madman, but ever had a lust for power 
 and glory.  A warrior-king he was, proud and mighty, worthy in battle and just
 in rule.  In the end, however, his greed overcame him, and as his victories in
 battle increased, his happiness waned.  He began to consult with untrustworthy
 wizards, but for a long while he was unable to find what he sought.  Failure
 after failure left many wizard heads impaled on the gates to the Royal Palace.
 Finally, to our dismay and doom, the necromancer Zorastra came, and her beauty
 and power awed Yeshuz.  Together they probed the secrets of life and death,
 searching for that which the King forever sought-- immortality.  

 It is not known whether or not Zorastra intentionally betrayed Yeshuz.  One
 night, she and King Yeshuz went to the museum in the centre of the city, the
 only place where the spell of great power could be cast-- Zorastra planned to
 drain the energy of the entire city to power a portal to the outer planes, and
 this necessitated a central location.  Once there, the Necromancer queen began
 her dread spell, and the entire city bend under her magical yoke.  With a 
 blinding flash of light, a dark portal snapped into being, and the demon lord
 Goru-Nezar stepped out.  Little did they realize what a scourge they had let
 free into our world!  Zorastra, overconfident in her power, commanded the 
 demon lord to reveal to them the secrets of undying existance.  With a 
 horrible sneer, he granted her wish.  Raising his hand, he pointed at her, and
 a dark beam speared forth.  King Yeshuz watched in horror as Zorastra's body
 began to decompose, completely rotting away within a few moments!  Goru-Nezar
Ƚ'7532"
477,1,0," then trapped hey soul in the undead form of a shadowraith, thus fulfilling her
 with for immortality-- if not in the manner she expected.  Yeshuz, horrified
 beyond all explanation, turned to flee, but the great demon lord grasped him
 with his ungodly strength and hurled him screaming through the dark portal. 
 
 All this time, I had been aware of these happenings, and watched with dismay
 through my scrying orb.  Now Goru-Nezar noticed me, looked straight at me
 through the orb, and laughed.  With a flick of his hand, my crystal ball
 shattered, and I was left bleeding from many cuts.  This was two days ago. 
 Since then, the demon lord has been widening the portal, increasing its power
 so as to allow his unholy horde of demonic warriors to pour forth and ravage
 the city.  I know they will not stop there, like a plague they will scour the
 land, destroying all trace of life and goodness they encounter.  Already much
 of the city has been destroyed by the ravenous demons, and only a handful have
 entered through that accursed portal.

 My time here is waning.  It is only a matter of time before the demons find 
 this concealed chamber and destroy me.  I have tranported the holy master of
 the temple to me, and together we will attempt to attract the mercy of the
 gods.  We stand together in a circle of protection of my fabrication, so for
 a short time we are safe.  Our prayer will be for the gods to blast this city
 into nothingness-- anything less may mean the escape of these unholy horrors,
 and in a few short hours no-one will be left.  These few words will be my
 last, as it is now time to begin our lengthy prayer.  May the gods have mercy
 on our souls.""

 [0;32m""Indeed you have performed a valuable service in the past. Let me tell you of
  our latest problem a hero such as you might solve: hundreds of years ago, a
  power-hungry king named Yeshuz attempted the unforgiveable in his attempt to
  discover the secrets of immortality-- with the aid of his powerful 
  necromancer mistress he opened a portal to the demonic planes. In short, the
  demon lord who stepped forth was far too powerful for them to control. He 
  drained the life from the necromancer, transforming her into a shadowraith,
  and hurled king Yeshuz into the portal behind him. Then the demon lord,
  Goru-Nezar, proceeded to widen the portal and in poured his demonic hordes.
  The next two days resulted in the death of nearly every living being and the
  complete sack and ruination of the city. Only the efforts of the Archmage
  Kale and the high priest of the city halted the destruction, but at a price--
  their prayers called upon the mercy of the forgotten gods, who unleased their
  power and annihilated every moving thing in the city, which was consequently
  blasted and cursed.""

 ""Goru-Nezar still survives, despite that horrible cataclysm. At the last 
  moment he completed a spell that allowed him to survive the gods' power, but
  at a price-- his form was destroyed, and his spirit was forced to roam the 
  planes substanceless for five hundred years. Now, however, his strength has
  come to the point where he has been able to possess the body of a mighty
  ogre-mage warlord, and in this shell he controls a small army. He has 
  returned to the ancient blasted city, and seeks to re-open the portal and
  once again feel the black winds of his home plane. You must stop him. Seek
  out the ogre-mage Goru-Nezar, and destroy him utterly. He is very weak after
  casting the  possession spell, and if his body is destroyed his spirit may

 The archmage has a power that allows him to scry the integrity of the magical

 proper passwords and keys were to be had, if he was watching. So, logically,
 your next mission is to deal with him, in whatever manner you see fit-- as

 her guard room. Do not ask how I obtained this copy. The other key will open
 an underwater grate, at the bottom of the moat at the rear of the castle. This
 is the only way you will be able to enter-- I do not have the resources to
 open the front way. You must dive into the moat in front of the drawbridge,
 swim around to the back of the castle, and from there infiltrate to the
 fortress heart up through the dungeon. This will not be easy-- bizarre
 creatures live in the moat, and you will be attacked on sight in the castle.
 Also, the throne room is heavily guarded, and a frontal assault will be near-
 suicidal without an incredible party of attackers. Nonetheless, this is your
 only option. Now, our alliance is at an end. I have what I want, and so do
 you-- now begone and finish what you came here for.""

 Teeth west of Silvermere until you hit the fork with the sign. Take the south
 fork, and follow it south and west until it starts to turn to the southeast.
 DON'T go southeast. Follow the path there to the south and west. Don't follow
 any paths that turn east. The path will go south, then west and north, curving
 up like a U. Eventually there will be another junction of paths, where one
 keeps going north and one turns to the southwest. Follow that one for a little
 while until it meets another path going to the southwest. At that junction,
 hold up this talisman and the secret entrance will be revealed to you.""

 Fortunately for the denizens of light, they have not yet succeeded in
 formulating the plague, though they have crafted other, less specific diseases
 in their attempts. The wererats are nearly immune to plagues and are 
 completely immune to poisons, making them ideal allies in this project. They
 have constructed an unholy contraption, which they pump full of concoctions,
 continually altering the formula and testing it on a host of slaves they 
 have in cells below for just such purposes. Needless to say, the survival

 Dark One underestimated the powers secretly assembled in Silvermere-- his
 armies had attacked fortresses of the light all over the realm, and many had
 fallen-- but the survivors all fled to Silvermere. And many forces, seemingly
 routed and slain, had actually made themselves look defeated only to regroup
 and join the main force. Also, all the great heroes had long since traveled to
 Silvermere in stealth, not revealing their identities until the final battle.
 In this way, the incarnation of the Dark One and his legion of evil were
 struck down. The countless graveyards and tombs that sprung up after the war
 are a testament to the Dark One's cunning, however-- even with the surprise he
 received, he managed to slay many of the strongest heroes and their forces.
 Soon, I fear, he will show himself once again, his power bloated from the
 countless sacrifices his minions have performed over the last five hundred
 years. And judging from the slothful, unattentive state of the armies of the
 light in current years, we have much to fear.>

 our income, as the demons are resistant to most weapons, and are merciless
 when they attack. The normal creatures that lurk in the mines, we have little
 trouble with-- the dwarves of Khazarad are mighty warriors. But these hellish
 creatures scoff at plain iron, as it glances off of them like rain off of a

""I suppose it all started when one of our miners stumbled upon a massive,
 glittering gem of the purest blue embedded in the mine wall deep down in the
 mithril mines. Naturally, great efforts were undertaken to loosen it from the
 wall's grasp, but it did not come. Finally, under the incredible pressures
 we applied, it cracked. A brilliant blue light flashed out, and a thunderclap
 made us all reel in pain. From the shards of the gem smoked out a wispy mist,
 which began to spin and whirl in a vortex. After a moment, it had formed a
 sort of oval disc about ten feet tall. Much to our surprise, a minute later a
 horrible nightmare creature stepped out of it! The rest, as they say, is 
 history. More of the demonic beasts poured out of the portal, and more dwarves
 went to fight them. It wasn't going so bad until IT appeared. Massive and 
 hideous beyond all explanation, it was shrouded in an otherworldy darkness
 that brought fear into the hearts of even the strongest warriors. I was the
 only one who could face it, and when I did, even my keen mithril axe was
 turned aside by its demonic skin. Terribly wounded, I nonetheless managed to
 make it back to the upper mines, where I was brought here.""

""That greater demon is a scourge to the mountain. I fear that it is waiting 
 down there, accumulating its power so that it can attempt a massive strike to
 wipe out our city. The unreasoning hatred these demons display is unmatched,

 problem probably could have been avoided had someone listened to my advice. 
 The king considers me a senile old fool, and though I must admit I am prone to
 rambling sometimes, there are things I see and read that no one else has the
 patience to discover! For example, just last week I found a priceless formula
 for curing a most troublesome problem that afflicts the warriors here-- Yellow
 Foot. It is a fungus that causes the feet to stink quite awfully, creating
 tension in the barracks and making one be embarrased by the smell wherever one
 goes. The cure is to obtain a smooth chunk of crystal, and to treat it with a
 soltuion of Limestone Powder, Slug Tongue and...""

[0mWhen he sees your eyes glazing over in boredom, he clears his throat and 
continues:

[0;32m""Hrm. Ah, yes, well I assume you are not here to defeat the evils of Yellow 
 Foot disease. What was I going to say again? Ahh yes, the problem in the 
 mines. To make a long story short, I knew this was going to happen. It was
 propecised in the Book of Koll, an ancient dwarven manuscript that few sages
 nowadays have the skills to decipher. I of course have no such problem, and
 while poring through its pages I happened upon a short passage, that told 
 about a horrible scourge that was entombed deep below the mountain. It was 
 held in a massive blue gem, that sparkled unlike any other stone ever 
 discovered. Well, it was buried in the lowest mine for a reason, and that is
 what I told the king when I heard he was authorizing deeper mines to be dug.
 Of course I was not listened to, and that's why you're here now. The [0;1;32mdemons[0;32m

[0;32m""According to the ancient text, the demons can only be slain by special
 weapons. Normal ones will not even scratch them, and the longer they stay in
 this plane, the more resistant they become. In addition, their leader is
 completely impervious to any metal from this world! He is the key to removing
 their presence, as he keeps open the portal that was created with the breaking
 of the gem. It appears an arcane ritual must be followed to forge a unique
 weapon, the only thing that can harm this hellish creature: the Spirit Dagger
 of Goijar. I won't tell you what the prophecy says in its entirety, as the 
 text is two-hundred pages long and we would likely be overrun by the time I
 was finished. In short, you must find a material to craft the physical form of
 the dagger. The metal you must find cannot come from this world-- thankfully I
 can help you with that. I have observed a strange comet that struck down in
 the Dragon's Teeth hills like a fireball. It displayed some odd properties
 that have led me to find that it contains the material you seek. Then you must
 get it forged into a weapon, and this is the easy part, as the master smith
 Martok is the finest weaponsmith in this part of the world. Ask him to forge a
 weapon with the metal once you have found it. However, this weapon alone will
 not be enough to harm the greater demon-- there are magical and spiritual
 components as well. These, however, I have no knowledge of. I know that there
 is an aging enchantress in the village of the gnomes who may aid you: seek her
 out, it may be that she will provide you with the rest of the information.""

[0;32m""Hmm... I have never heard of this dagger, but the process of binding a spirit
 to an enchanted object is not unheard of. I believe I could do it, though it
 will be greatly taxing. Like the Loremaster said, there are three steps in
 creating this dagger: first, you must find a metal not of this world, and have
 it forged into a weapon. Second, you must bring this dagger to me, and I must
 [0;1;32menchant[0;32m it with a complex spell of binding. This will allow you to trap a
 spirit of great power within the blade, creating the Spirit Dagger of Goijar.
 The spirit required for this last step must be a soul of great power, and one
 unjustly forced to remain after death in this world against its will. Slaying
 it with the enchanted dagger will both trap its life force in the weapon, and
 also provide the means for its liberation-- for when the demon Gulgluthra is
 slain with the dagger, it will shatter, releasing the trapped spirit to where
 it should rightfully be.""

[0;32m<Once again, your services will prove useful to the cause of Balance. This time
 the task is of grave urgancy, and there is no room for error. The problem is
 this: though few have heard of the goddess Aerdwyne, she is a force that is
 ever-present in the world. Her domain is that of Justice and Truth-- the 
 patron of all who would seek out wrongdoings by both the Light and the Dark.
 However, it has been long since her presence has been felt, and I fear that
 something has happened to her Avatar, who is the embodiment of her power here
 on earth. You must seek out the Shrine of Aerdwyne, though its location has
 been lost for some time. My only advice is search past the barrier in the
 Darkwood forest, and attempt to find one of her wandering clerics-- they are
 few and far between, but one may be able to direct you to her shrine. Once
 there, [0;36mpray[0;32m at the shrine and receive her guidance. Only after you have

[0mYou humbly speak about the Grey Lord and his wishes.

[0;32m""The Grey Lord is a friend indeed, and is correct when he worries that 
 something has gone amiss. The truth of the matter is that this unnatural swamp
 sprang up around my shrine, and it smacks of black sorcery. Travelers could no
 longer stop here to pray, and with their absence my power wanes. Of late, I
 cannot even send down my Avatar to perform her duties, which is a sore blow to
 the balance of things. This is one reason why the war between the light and
 darkness is escalating.""

""You must provide me with the energy to send down my Avatar. This is no easy
 task, and will require you to seach throughout the realm for four elemental
 artifacts. The first is the Ice Tear, and will represent the sorrow for the
 injustices that pass unanswered in the world. The second is the Eternal Flame,
 a sphere of heatless flame that will symbolize the ceaseless search for
 Justice. The third artifact is the Heartstone, an indestructible gem of a 
 thousand facets. It reflects the need for eternal vigilance and the myriad
 forms that righteousness can take. The fourth and final artifact is the Spirit
 of the Storm, and it represents both the lightning-swift judgement and the
 righteous fury of the agents of Justice.""

""These four artifacts must be collected in the proper order-- the [0;1mIce Tear[0;32m,

sharp nails on the surface of his desk, and as you approach, he glares at you.

his face brightens in surprise, and he laughs evilly.

[0;32m""Ha! I have it. Good fortune has brought you to me today! There is a problem 
 that needs to be solved, and you, my friend, will solve it for me. You see,
 there is a matter of some importance that is preventing my actions in the area
 to the east of Silvermere from succeeding. I require an covert ally there to
 retrieve information for me, conduct assassinations, the regular sort of
 thing. A source has told me that an exiled sect of dwarves, the Duergar, are
 living in the caverns of the Khazarad mountains. They would be ideal for my
 purposes, but all attempts to find them have been met with failure. If it were
 not for your timely arrival, I would likely have executed a few of my servants
 in wrath.""

[0;32m""Your task is to find and talk with the leader of these Duergar. A rumour I 
 have heard is that one of the Duergar has been cast out of the group to die
 alone and defenseless. However, the vermin has survived, and supposedly is
 lurking somewhere in Silvermere. If you find him, you will certainly find the
 way to the Duergar stronghold. Go now. Come back with news of their [0;1;32malliance[0;32m,

1416,0,0,"[0mWhen the light in the sky flies once again this shall be a sign of the Dark
One's return. The light is of such beauty that it appears with the grace of a
bird, and is given the name Phoenix. The light of such elegance that many a man
fell to his knees in awe of her.

For the Phoenix represents the rebirthing of the ages. The ages come and go but
the light remains. It is this bond that links all the events of this reality. 
It is the change and the growth of all beings. It is the power that challenges
us to change, and forces us to understand. For it is the universe's tool of
change, and is a tool of great power.

Towards the end of the last Great War, the great light vanished, gone from the
world of mortals, until the time when the darkness would rise again.

For the Dark One knew of the Phoenix and knew if he were to catch her that
this would be a testament to his power and a challenge to the other gods. The
Dark One had long been beguiled by the beauty of the Phoenix and became
obsessed with a desire to possess her.

The great Legends knew of the desires of the Dark One and requested of the 
Phoenix to assist them in their quest to defeat the Dark One's Armies. The
Phoenix, knowing of the danger that the Dark One represented, agreed in
assisting them in their battle against the Lord of Shadows.

For many months the Legends managed to distract the Dark One with the Phoenix,
until he became obsessed enough to divert his Avatar away from Silvermere and
towards the Phoenix's home, The Stronghold of the Templars of Golden Light, an
ancient society of warriors who gave themselves to the Phoenix as guardians of
her and her ultimate destiny in the realm.

There the Dark One's Avatar besieged the fortress in a futile attempt to
capture the Phoenix. While this occurred, it gave opportunity to the Legends to
bring their scattered forces to bear on the Dark One. Unfortunately, on the eve
of the Legendary Heroes' assault, The Dark One, who had grown furious at Ƚ'7532"
1416,1,0,"Avatar's failure, intervened and violated a sacred law of the realm, using
ancient technology long lost and forbidden in the realm. He succeeded, 
breaching the walls of the stronghold and overwhelming the Templars, who in the 
heat of the battle were unable to stop many of the dark one's heroes from
entering the Phoenix's lair. 

Many of the Legends, knowing that they had failed the Phoenix, retreated with
their forces back to Silvermere to await the final conflict with the Dark One's
Avatar. Orfeo Talespinner remained with a small band of his henchmen and
managed to fight his way into the catacombs where the Phoenix lair was located.
Orfeo to this day speaks not of this experience, only knowing the pain of his
failure in stopping the Dark One's army from taking the stronghold.

With the destruction of the Stronghold, the Dark One's Avatar turned his
attention to the great city of Silvermere, his last obstacle in conquering the
realm. Little did he know that the Legends had been given the time to bring
their fragmented armies together. Forces of Light from across the realm had
signed an alliance to either defeat the Dark One or be vanquished in the
attempt.

At this last battle the Legends defeated the Dark One's Avatar. The great mage
Morukai, using magics bestowed upon him by the gods to counterbalance the Dark
One's forbidden intervention, countered many of the Avatar's unholy protective
powers. Vulnerable and surprised by the combined forces of the Armies of Light,
the Dark One's Avatar was overrun and destroyed by Dorshar Lightblade and the
other legendary heroes who still survived. 

This resulted in the beginning of a new age, the Age of Tranquility. With the
Dark One's power temporarily broken, the hosts of shadow fell into disarray and
were scattered about the land like chaff on the wind. The armies of light, 
decimated by the terrible war, returned to their homelands to rebuild and begin

 proven yourself worthy. Now you must prepare for the final stage of your 
 quest-- resurrecting the Phoenix so that her influence may restore the 
 balance that her capture had destroyed. To do this, you must take the egg to
 a place where this realm and the plane of fire meet. Here, and only here, may
 the Phoenix be resurrected. Such a place I sometimes use for various other
 reasons, and I may direct you to it. Down beneath the undercaverns of 
 Silvermere, there is a fiery plain where lava seeps in from below. At the
 northern edge of this plain, there is a sealed doorway, which only I may 
 open. You must go there, and hurl the egg into the lake of fire which lies
 beyond the door. Then your quest will be finished. Take this key, and make

with all of your might. As it plunges towards the lake's burning surface, the 
egg begins to glow with a flickering white aura. Striking the fiery magma, it 
explodes in a flash of golden light!

Out the burning lake streaks forth an achingly beautiful form, as brilliant as
the stars and swift as the wind. Flying up out of the flames, the Phoenix,
reborn, lands on the edge of the ledge. With a gaze both tender and terrible,
you suddenly understand the legendary creature's thoughts-- that you have 
the thanks and everlasting friendship of this beautiful being, and that you 
will never be forgotten for your service.

With a flashing leap, the Phoenix surges into the air once more, circling over
you slowly. A glowing, fluttering object-- a feather-- floats down from her
wing and lands at your feet, and then, abruptly, she is gone in a streak of
flame.

strangely-accented dialect, he says:

[0;32m""May you find shade, fellow wanderer. It is my privilege and honour to be able
 to travel through this fine land. So different than my [0;1;32mhomeland[0;32m, which is a
 sandy waste, though I love it nonetheless. Alas, I wish that my time here was
 for recreation, as I would relish such extravagances as shadowed forests and
 secluded pools. My mission here is of some urgency, though I doubt you would
 be concerned of such [0;1;32mmatters[0;32m.""

 But for we Nekojin, it is hospitable enough. It would be futile for me to
 describe the beauty of the moon, hanging like a ghostly eye over the
 serpentine backs of the sand dunes. Even in the face of such lush greenery
 that may be seen in this country, I miss it still.""

 things occur in the desert, as a pall of evil has come over the land. The
 great pyramids, once abandoned and forgotten, are now rife with all manner of
 vile beast, and hordes of bloodthirsty Saracen roam freely. All can feel that
 something terrible will soon occur, and I am here to enlist aid, if there is
 any. I passed through the Dwarven stronghold of Khazarad, but the folk there
 were too consumed with their own business to take note of my pleas. I hoped
 to travel to Silvermere to inquire further... if you would be inclined to 
 investigate this matter, you may speak to our village elder. He knows far
 more than I, and has insights into these matters. Seek our village past the 
 Dwarven mountain, where the desert washes up against its eastern side.""

[0;32m""An outsider, at long last. Precious few strangers do we see here, though
 truthfully many more than in the past. Most travelers are either Dwarves,
 traveling here solely for trading purposes, or accursed [0;1;32mSaracens[0;32m, who come
 to raid and plunder. Thankfully both are rarities. The Dwarves are friendly
 enough, as long as you are interested in their wares, but the Saracens are
 ruthless butchers who follow the fanatical teachings of their religious 
 leader without question. It is fortunate that my people are naturally
 inclined towards the path of the warrior, for we would have perished long ago
 under their onslaught. And they are the least of our [0;1;32mproblems[0;32m.""
Ƚ'7532"
2560,0,0,"[0;32m""There are problems that go beyond even the raids of the Saracens or the
 harshness of the desert. As you undoubtably are unaware of, during the last
 age there existed a prosperous land here, ruled by a Pharaoh of great might.
 Near the end of the age he became very greedy, and sought to cheat death. As
 part of this endless greed he constructed a great [0;1;32mpyramid[0;32m in the centre of 
 the realm. As the sandstone quarry ran out, he destroyed whole towns in his
 efforts to complete the pyramid. All the while the evil force of his will,
 along with the desecration of the land and pillaging of the cities, drained
 the land of its life-- transforming it into this desert wasteland.""
Ƚ'7532"
2561,0,0,"[0;32m""The pharaoh succeeded in his quest to complete the construction of the 
 pyramid, though it cost the people of the land greatly. But to their mystery,
 the expected reign of terror did not come. Silently, and without warning,
 the pharaoh vanished, as did all entrances to the pyramid. Many speculate on
 what actually happened, but I surmise that some great force sealed the
 reckless pharaoh in his own citadel of power. He may even be there now,
 his black hatred growing stronger over the centuries. This is one of the 
 things that worries me-- lately strange dark clouds have been seen converging
 over the pyramid. Also, the desert [0;1;32mtraders[0;32m, who have a stronghold
 nearby the pyramid, say that their trading has been disrupted by increased
 monster activity.""

 be an excellent place to begin looking for answers, as they receive the best

 traders has a Seeress who advises him in his business activities. You would
 be wise to seek their aid.""

 heartless killers, but we have grown wise to their tactics, and now they
 are rarely seen around these parts. Dozens of their severed heads placed out
 to bake in the sun and be ravaged by scavengers made sure of that. They all

will help you in your quest. However, the book has many pages, and further
study may yield something of benefit.
Ƚ'7532"
2609,0,0,"[0mAfter some time of fruitless translation, you suddenly come upon a short 
passage detailing a part of the history of the pharaoh:

[0;36m""...It was only after the pharaoh had exhausted the quarry's supply of 
 sandstone did he make the decision to delve further into the mountainside.
 Long did the slaves labour under the burning sun to carve out more stone 
 blocks for the pharaoh's pyramid, and many perished under the cruel whips of
 the overseers. Winding tunnels had pierced the quarry walls, delving deep 
 into the rock, when they came upon the ore.

 Blood-red it was, and harder than steel. When the overseers first reported
 the metal to the pharaoh, he immediately was overcome with lustful images of
 his armies wielding strong new weapons. He doubled the number of slaves, and
 set them to mining this new ore. So great was his want for the strange metal,
 that thousands died and were dragged outside for the carrion-birds to devour.
 Tensions rose as even the strongest slaves began to weaken from malnutrition
 and abuse. Finally, one day, as the pharaoh was personally overseeing the
 mining operation, an angry slave picked up a jagged chunk of the red iron ore
 and flung it at the pharaoh.

 What happened next was a shock to everyone. All knew that the pharaoh was a 
 mighty wizard, and many had perished while attempting to slay him. Normal
 weaponry simply would not harm him, as he was cloaked in a magical barrier.
 However, when the chunk of red ore struck the pharaoh in the head, he reeled
 backward, blood dripping from a deep cut. For what seemed like an eternity,
 all froze in shock and horror. Then, suddenly, incredulous that he had been
 harmed by a mere slave, the pharaoh unleashed a storm of flame upon the slave
 that incinerated him on the spot. Their daze broken by the magical
 destruction of their comrade, the other slaves immediately began stoning the
 pharaoh with shards of the red ore. 

Ƚ'7532"
2609,1,0," In a bloody fury, the pharaoh called upon his immense magical powers. Demonic
 magic swirled about the chamber, causing all who viewed it to stop what they
 were doing and quiver in terror. With a triumphant, bloodthirsty cry, the
 pharaoh completed his spell, and vanished.

 For a moment all thought he had simply left. Abruptly, however, a rumbling
 far beneath the earth rocked everyone off of their feet. The rock at the far
 end of the chamber split open with great violence, revealing a hideous dark
 abomination! The pharaoh, in his indignant hatred, had summoned a nether
 beast to devour all who remained in the mine.

 It is at this point that I turned and ran for my life. The sound of horrified
 slaves and overseers being devoured will haunt me for the rest of my life.
 Once a cruel overseer, I now am a simple monk who lives in penitence for my
 former crimes. Perhaps I was the only one who survived to tell this tale. 
 May God have mercy on their souls.""

2612,0,0,"[0mYou tell the seeress about your discovery of the ancient language, and the
historical account of the pharaoh's evil deeds. With a contemplative smile,
she says:

[0;32m""You have learned much in the forgotten library. Indeed, this will prove
 extremely useful in your quest. Knowledge of the language of the Az-Hammir 
 will likely be invaluable. And the secret of the red ore is... intriguing.
 That the pharaoh could be harmed by such a metal and by no others is 
 mystifying. But your discoveries have caused me to forget what I have found
 in your absence! Listen closely.""

""While you were pursuing this information, I cast my eye about the land in
 search of secrets that would aid your quest. And by the grace of the gods, I
 found that which I sought. The first, and most important, is that the pharaoh
 has long been possessed by an evil spirit. The details I obtained were not
 exact, but even since those ancient times he has been a puppet for a powerful
 spirit from an outer plane. This spirit is the cause of his great power, and
 perhaps his vulnerability to that red ore. I believe that this will be the
 key to defeating him. The quarry in which the red ore is located is to the
 southwest-- perhaps after obtaining the ore, the dwarves of Khazarad could
 forge a weapon out of it for you. The second piece of information that I 
 found is that all entrances to the pyramid have long ago been sealed. There
 is no known way to remove these seals. However, there once were secret 
 underground tunnels that were connected to a temple of the Dark One, and they
 may lead into the pyramid. However, I could not find anyone who knows where
 this temple is located! Only one vague rumour was revealed to me-- that one
 priest, hundreds of years old and cursed with the 'gift' of eternal life and
 suffering by the Dark One, still roams this land. Perhaps he, if he has not 
 been rendered insane by the Dark One's power, could be persuaded to reveal
Ƚ'7532"
2612,1,0," the secret entrance to the forgotten temple.""

""The time of reckoning has come. I have given you all the aid that has been
 mine to give, and now you must go forth and vanquish the pharaoh once and for
 all. Remember what you have been told, and remember the secrets you uncovered
 in the ancient library. Good luck, and godspeed.""

thunder, and the light is flashing like lightning. Abruptly, with a brilliant
stroke, the light flares out, leaving you dazed!

You stumble out of the Focus, your vision slowly beginning to clear. With a
heavy hand, the temple master grips you by the shoulders, speaking softly and
saying:

[0;32m""Go now, as a mature member of our race. One of the chosen of the holy ones.

quite the marvel of magic isn't it.  The mages of Cirgathil told you of
it didn't they?  Such a jealous bunch they are always in competition
with each other as to who's magic is more powerful, having summoning
contests that last for days.  Transportation is where the real magic
is my child.  It doesn't matter how powerful you are if you can't get
anywhere to do anything with it.""

build it and I alone know the workings of its magic.  I'm a reasonable
man though and seeing as I haven't been home for over 500 years I'm sure
my wife has sold off all my [0;1;32mbelongings[0;32m.  So for a small [0;1;32mfee[0;32m to help

I'll only charge you 10,000 gold.  I know you would like to give me more
but I'm sure there are other charities you are looking to give your
money too. If you have the money on you just ask me to [0;1;32mactivate[0;32m the portal
and you will be through and there in the blink of an eye.  By the 
dirt you wear I'd say you were from that small fishing village across
the river from my home, if you would like I could you even send you [0;1;32mhome[0;32m

 [0;32m<Very well.  Ages ago a dragon of this earth awoke and began to
 terrorize these caverns. As is always the case, many denizens came and
 inhabited the caves with it. Finally, we were left no choice but to do
 battle with the dragon, and a long costly war ensued. We were able to
 force it to retreat slowly, for it was still young, until at last we
 trapped it in an old lava tube and locked it away in magical stone.
 However, days ago the volcano that was once dormant has now become
 violently active, and the aged dragon is free to exact its revenge
 on us. Many of our most powerful spell weavers and magi were lost
 in the battle long ago, and there is no hope for us to trap it in
 stone once again. I ask you now to slay this dragon, and return to me
 a [0;1;32mclaw[0;32m as proof of its death. If you do as much, I can help you
 continue your quest to its completion, whatever that may be.>

useful tools and weapons, as well as livestock and slaves have come to
our city over the years.

About two years ago we acquired a slave with some minor talents in
healing and curative skills.  He has lived peacefully in our city for

[0mShe takes a deep breath, shaking her head sadly.

[0;32m""Together, they were somehow able to combine forces and draw tenfold
their power. I think the initial intent was simply to escape, but the
surge in energy they drew had a dark taint to it.  It was almost as if
they were being influenced by an outside malevolent force.  They killed

[0mShe pauses to a take a deep breath and continues,

 [0;32m""Recent reports from our sources have told us of a force of

his voice echos through the caverns of your mind:

[0;32m<Very well young one, I do have a mission of the utmost importance,
it seems like a simple one but it will test you in many ways.>

[0mThen the voice goes silent, and with a slight wave of his hand an
image appears in front of you. The image is that of grey scale, one
side the scale cup is bright white, and on the other side the cup is
darkness blacker then a starless night. The scale itself is that of
a dull grey color.

[0mThe lord's voice echos in your head:
[0;32m<Humor me for a moment young one, for I must show you the
importance of this mission, but I must start simple.>

[0mSuddenly the scales go in motion, each side trying to gain weight
over the other, the scales dip and toss and you almost think they
will topple, until the greyness seems to move towards each side,
constantly keeping them in an uneasy balance, as you watch your
head is filled with the Grey Lord's voice.

[0;32m<As you know this is the present way the forces of good and
evil are kept in balance, through our efforts no side gains weight

splotch begins to grow and spreads like a cancerous growth to cover
the scales entirely, until finally consuming the entire thing the
scales disentigrate. Then the voice continues:

It concerns me that I was unable to detect it until so I can only
assume a cloaking method of some kind. However, now that it is
making itself apparent I sense incredible evil within it, of much
greater magnitude then Balthazar could ever hope to achieve. This
is a malevolence that cares not about the Balance, or this realm

snarl dismisses the messenger. The white fanged man reads through the
scroll intently, then lets loose a string of gutteral curses. His face
turns dark red and he continues to curse and stomp around madly. He
bellows something at his lieutenants who are all scurrying around like
headless chickens. Finally he turns to you and as you wince in the
expectation that he is about to strike you he stops dead in his tracks.

His red eyes staring right at you he says,

[0mHesitantly you describe your journey through the jungle, and
caverns to your final battle in the volcano with the dark phoenix.
As you describe the death of the phoenix, Balthazar grins evilly,
sending a chill down your back, for as you tell of the dark figure

grim and stone-like.

You end your story and look for a reaction, but you can't tell if
he is about to obliterate you, or applaud you. An eternity of

to one of his dark-garbed servants who runs off, shortly after he
returns with a bundle of black cloth.

[0mThe ancient kai master takes a deep breath and looks far off.

 [0;32m""It all began when my master decided to travel back to his homeland.
 Since I was his student it was my duty to accompany him. We boarded a ship,
 and traveled over water for many days. Finally we landed and I traveled
 abroad with him.

 The people of this land were not like us, they all had light tan skin, and
 black hair. However, they all developed fighting forms, or stances, ways
 to better oneself in combat. There are five forms I learned, the form of
 the crane, the form of the gorilla, the form of the monkey, and the form
 of the viper. I was fortunate to have this knowledge passed down to me,
 and so I shall pass it down to you. To achieve this knowledge you must do
 battle with the spirits of these catacombs, and they will relinquish a
 totem. [0;1;32mGive the totem to me[0;32m and this will show me you are ready to
 learn that form. An important thing to know of these forms is they require
 great focus, so you will need to invoke them to become inhabited by the
 spirit of the form. Now hurry, I do not know how long I have.""

blow that you deliver and not only is the damage great but the chance to SMASH
them and knocking them down is great as well. Let me give you an example"",
and before you know it you are on your back staring up at the chuckling face
of the old warrior. He gestures for you to get up and practices with you some

""Come young one, let Aggie pass on to ye the legend.""
The old woman walks with you shortly away from prying eyes, then takes a small blue stone from a pouch:
""Many years ago gypsies roamed this land, bringing joy to all that passed, and often defending the traders from the bandits who believed this to be a good spot for an ambush. As time passed by the great war pushed into this area, the gypsies with a true heart for good fled, some deep into the desert, others into the swamps to the west. Many settled in an area around thy grey temple, in dire times the grey will protect any it can, even the white. Soon after something strange happened, a lonely beast wandered into camp, its head always staring at the ground, we thought it no harm. When two children fed it however the thing looked up, dooming the entire camp.""
As she speaks she tries to hold the tears back, but at this point begins to weep longingly:
""The gods had given it a heavy head, as protection for those who wandered near, its eyes killed whoever it glanced upon instantly, its way of turning normal food into the poison that it lived upon. To the gypsies however it was a horrid thing, their bodies crumbled beneath them. Aggie do not desire revenge, what is done is done, their fortune was poor, and the beast meant no harm. If the beast was enchanted by some dark power I doubt any would live through the battle, friend or foe. If Aggie can fashion something that will save those who done it from the glance, but I will need the eye. If ye be either brave or foolish I bid you can get one for me, please I beg you. This will serve to prove yer worth and grant the birthright that belongs in your hands.""

""Ages ago, a time of great peace filled the realm. This was the Age of
Prosperity and existed because a true balance between good and evil had
been reached. The few skirmishes that occurred were trivial, personal matters
and the consensus of citizens of the realm was that they felt safer than they
ever had before. Silvermere was experiencing success and growth greater than any other period in its history while alliances among all races were forged. It surely was an age of prosperity for all. Unfortunately, this could not last; prophecies, long since forgotten, predicted that the power balance would change, and change it did.

""Rhudar was a bustling town full of economic wealth during the Age of
Prosperity and its population was rapidly growing to rival Silvermere's.
Its temple, perceived by the realm to be honoring the codes and treaties
of the time, taught the ancient rituals of magick to any willing and devout
adventurer who applied. This alone helped increased the popularity of the
city. Unbeknownst to all, a calculated and growing evil was festering
within. The Grandmaster of the Shadow Fist Temple had grown more than
weary of his limited powers.""

Alexia pauses and takes a deep breath. Your heart sinks to hear a sad note in her voice as she continues speaking,

Grandmaster truly failed to appreciate that balance leads to prosperity,
is academic. Thus began the end of the Age of Prosperity and the

Working with a malefic diligence, the Grandmaster ordered the brotherhood to cull ancient documents and knowledge of dark magick from the realm. No one suspected his motives and no request for long-forgotten scrolls was denied.
It is the nature of evil to take simple agreement for weakness and it made
the Grandmaster impudently proud of the mass of information gathered by
his minions. He began to train a warrior to carry out his imminent conquering
and named his choice the Dark One's Avatar.

""While the haughty Grandmaster assumed his actions went ignored, one man
in the realm felt the tipping of the balance scale. Dorshar Lightblade, a
human and a witchhunter by profession, may have been the most balanced soul to
have ever existed in the realm. It was the Phoenix, Bel-Lai, the embodiment of
divine equilibrium, which selected Dorshar, and which instructed and
charged him to devote his life and energies to a golden mean of balance. Neither
side in the struggle for good and evil should gain too much power.
Domination by one side or the other would lead to destruction of the realm. Neither good nor evil could exist truly without the other. Dorshar worked quietly, remaining a passive observer, mindful that his own interfering within the realm might be as disruptive of balance as any overt attempt of good or evil. When he discovered the scheme of the Grandmaster and informed the Phoenix, immediate action was necessary. Battles raged for years, yet the Grandmaster's strength increased. Dorshar, alignȽ'7532"

Then, at the darkest moment, the Dark One's Avatar moved to gain control of the Phoenix herself, to obtain ultimate power for the Grandmaster. Dorshar led the Templars of the Golden Light, a holy order sworn to protect the Phoenix, against the seemingly unstoppable Avatar. Tragically, it appeared to all that the Grandmaster would succeed in his corrupted plans.""

Alexia's eyes wistfully twinkle now and your spirit lifts with hers as she
completes her tale.
""Bel-Lai had not though, existed for eons without learning a trick or two
herself. The Phoenix determined that avoiding the destruction of the
realm, even at the cost of her own liberty warranted sacrifice. She entreated
Morukai, a mage of legendary renown, to imprison her in a manner to keep
her from the clutches of the Grandmaster. Although this was accomplished
successfully and the Grandmaster was stopped in his quest for ultimate
domination and power, the Age of Prosperity was now only a memory. To this
day, the scales of good and evil tip precariously back and forth with new
threats to it constantly. Only the actions of new adventurers will
determine what fate has in store for the realm.""

Looking back into your eyes Alexia smiles, sees that you understand, and nods approvingly.

I am originally from a city to the west, but in my travels I was beset by ruffians and suddenly woke up here."" Another sigh escapes her, this one of longing, ""I'd like nothing more but to have a chance to return to Valfro, however with the avalanche blocking all traffic, it makes it more then impossible."" She smiles, her face lighting up with hope, and with a bright twinkle in here eye says, ""So I shall just make the best I can here, fret not for Alexia, for I am very capable of taking care of myself.""

Suddenly you are high above in the air, overlooking a city that looks ......hauntingly familiar.....yet this city is none like you have seen before, full of corruption and death. A horrid stench rises up causing you to choke and gag....
Something is pulling at you, tugging at your life strings! You feel yourself drawn to the far side, the eastern side, but it's not where it would be! 
You descend rapidly towards it and yet abruptly come to a halt. A great tug of war ensues over you, and you find yourself flung backwards through the streets. A loud thud drops you in the middle, but no one seems to notice.....
To the south you see a dark, wretched tower, rising over the city like a skeletal finger. East is a gargantuan fortress of blackness. North is a land filled with the poor, the plagued and the wretches. You are certain now you have never been here, and yet the buildings tug at your mind. 
Unexpectadly you are surrounded by black armoured men, with skulled great helms, and cruel weapons....then a portal appears, causing them to snarl and back away! You are sucked in and then....
A plane of black surrounds you, only a single silver light draws your notice. Without thought you are at the source. It is the Timelord! Yet it is not. Various differences are about him, before you can contemplate further his voice echoes in your mind:

He then unravels his clothed item and reveals a bright blue blade, that shines with magical power. He lays it on the floor and gestures for you to take it.
Whispering he says ""The vial given to me will heal my internal wounds, allowing me some comfort in this cold prison. I do not expect I can escape the magics of the rakshasa, so to you I leave this sword, it has served me well and may it do the same for you.""

His skin was a shade of blue more akin to a flowers petal then to skin, and his eyes were completely green like the leaf of an apple tree. He was very fit, but for such a powerful looking individual he wore very little armor, merely a loincloth and a strange leaf-like headdress that seemed to sprout from his forehead. 
We sat side by side for a long time before I spoke to him, but once I did, his eyes seemed to lock to mine in an eerie stare. I asked him what he was exactly, he simply said that he was a traveler. After some talking I learned he was some type of great warrior, though his race is still unclear, if there are more like him I hope they are as charitable. We quickly became comfortable with one another, and he began to tell me the most bizarre of stories.
He told me that long ago his race sprung from the earth, but they emerged into a barren world. They created forests, rivers, mountains, and swamps out of the love of life and beauty. However the world did not have the energy to support this influx of life, so some areas were left natural, deserts. His race feared these areas and created great castles in every desert around the world to guard the earth from some unspoken power.
Among these he said the castle ruled by one named Nahr was the grandest. It's beauty was unmatched by any other mortal creation, and it housed the greatest knowledge and power of any single place in existence. Nahr was a mighty ruler and champion, but he craved power and was corrupted by the deserts negative energy. He took pleasure in looking across the scorching desert and the tricks the heat played on his eyes and he began to obsess with the power of illusions.

The illusion weavers were powerful, but were cut down quickly by the skilled warriors. However when Hiryuu came to the great castle he refused to destroy it, he chose instead to banish it beneath the sands of time for all time.
However, Hiryuu told me that recently he has noticed the dark powers collecting in the desert were causing the castle to come dangerously close to resurgence. He seemed almost pleased though, he told me that if one were powerful enough that great power could be found inside the castle. He even told me that the base of the castle contained great tests of skill for a chosen few to prove there worth of the ultimate training.
I miss my friend Hiryuu these days; it seems he left for the desert, he told such good stories when he drank too much. The funny thing is he drank through his hands, ah well, at least it looked like he did after a few too many ales.""
With that he goes back to his drink.

way to gain respite from my prison, and to continue to gain knowledge in the

assist me in this. The task will be difficult, the challenge will be both

have survived and brought me the stones. Now, at long last, I may know what
it is like to stand with the sun on my face again."" He immediately begins 
preparations for the task at hand. Walking all along the floor he places a
single diamond, eventually you see some sort of mythical pattern emerging
from the floor, and he then stands in the middle of it. He signals for you to be
silent as he begins a low hum that rumbles from deep in his chest. Eventually
it seems to become more prominent, and you feel an itching behind your ears.
The hum turns into a full rumble, and you almost wonder if the room is
shaking. His eyes light up with power and he raises his hands to the ceiling,
shouting long gutteral words and phrases. There is a flash, and you are almost
knocked to the ground by an unseen force. You open your eyes to see the mage,
looking more haggard then before. With saddened eyes he whispers ""Alas, I have
failed, the magic would appear to be too great for me."" For a moment there is
silence and he looks up at you. ""But that is still no reason for you to lose
out on your reward!"" he says handing you a glowing sigil. ""Rest now and ease
your wounds, RETURN this to me when you are ready and I shall fulfill our
agreement."" He sits down then and begins to meditate.

""Excellent! You may be the one I have been searching for. I shall prepare the
portal at once."" He starts shuffling through his books, looking for something
specific. ""The nanati are a secretive race that live on another plane. An
evil people, they dine on the flesh of others...sometimes even their own
kind."" He sits up with a book in hand, and looks at you again. ""In their
foreheads grow dark stones, rich with magical power. If I had enough of these
stones, I think I may be able to overpower the spell imprisoning me. I will
REWARD you greatly for bringing 50 of these stones back to me. Just tell me
when you are READY to go and I shall open the portal. The wards that keep me
bound to this room will prevent my physical form from entering the portal, but

teach you the skill of meditation. It is the lost art of regaining your magic 
back swiftly. You must be in a state of complete relaxation to focus your 
mental powers on regeneration."" You sit with him, and let your body relax. 
A soft chant in imitation of Dhelvanen allows you to focus and feel energies 
forming that you've never felt before. When you awake, you feel stronger than
ever.

ready to use.

Exit the weapons shop by heading south once. Then head west once. If you have
the ability to use spells you will want to go to the spell store. Check your
Mana by typing ""st"". Mana is roughly translated to be your life force energy.
This can be used to cast spells. This energy is depleted as you cast spells
but you can type ""rest"" and you will recover this energy so that you may cast
more spells. If you would like to buy some spells, head north one. Use the
same procedure in the spell store that you used in the armor shop to look
around and see what items you can get for free. Once you have purchased a
scroll with a spell on it you will want to ""read <scroll name>"" in order to
know how to cast that spell. Once you learn a spell you can cast it as often
as you wish as long as you have enough Mana. If you want to cast a spell type
""cast, spell name, target"" i.e. ""cast magic missile kobold""

The adventurers store is south of the magic store. If your character doesn't
have night vision, you will want to buy some torches here. You may type ""help
class"" to see whether or not you can see in the dark. To use a torch in a
dark area simply type ""use torch"".

Move west and type ""Look down"". This is the arena where you will go to fight
monsters when you are ready.

Right now, however, you should move north to the trainer. Type ""exp"" and you
will see that as a brand new character you have no experience. You gain
experience by fighting and killing monsters. When you have enough experience
you can move up a level by coming to the trainer and typing ""train"". Every
time that you move up a level you obtain additional lives( you start with
nine) if you need any, as well as more hit points which help you stay alive
longer in combat. Hit points are like your physical mana, the state of your
health and the physical strength that you have available. You lose hit points
Ƚ'7532"
9035,1,0,"in combat and regain them by typing ""rest"".

The only reason that you as a new character need to visit the trainer is if
you haven't already allocated all of your character points which you obtained
when you first generated your character. You may do this by typing ""train
stats"".

Move south and west to the healer. Type ""read sign"". If you would like to
buy a healing spell, type ""buy <spell name>"" i.e. ""buy minor healing"". These
spells will give you back your hit points faster than you could regenerate
them by resting. Always watch your hit points! If you get down to zero hit
points and you have no friends around to help you, you will die!

Now that you have had a brief tour of New Haven, you will want to start
fighting some monsters so that you can gain experience and start to move up
in level. Move back to the arena. You may also want to review the combat help
file by typing ""help combat"". Before you go down into the arena check to make
sure that you are wearing your armor (not just carrying it), have your weapon
in your hand ready to use, and that you know the spells that you may want to
cast. You may want to practice your magic, if you have Mana, by casting a
blur spell on yourself before you enter combat. This spell will make you
harder to hit. You will also want to try using the magic missile spell.

If you are a class or race with stealth, you'll want to practice sneaking by
typing SN, type it again if it tells you you don't think you are sneaking.
Once you think you are sneaking type D for down, and then type BS MONSTERNAME
(i.e. bs kobold). BS stands for backstab. If you don't successfully sneak or
backstab, you can always go back up and try again.

If you are a mystic, you have special attacks listed in the help combat
screen. JU MONSTERNAME (i.e. ju kobold) to jumpkick, or PU MONSTERNAME to
punch.

If you are not a class or race with stealth, and you are not a mystic or
magic user, you will type A MONSTERNAME (i.e. a kobold) to attack. You do Ƚ'7532"
9035,2,0,"need to type any adjectives in front of the name of the monster. For example,
if you are attacking an angry giant rat you only need to type A RAT.

Go down into the arena. A monster will appear for you to fight. Don't wait
for the monster to attack you! Go get 'em! Watch your hit points. If you find
that you are getting close to zero type ""up"" to get out of the arena. Don't
worry if you get killed the first time. You have eight more lives and can
always create a new character if you want to. Once you have killed a monster,
you should check your hit points to see how many you have lost. If you have
only a few hit points left you might get killed by the next monster which
appears, so you will want to go up out of the arena and rest until you regain
your strength. If you should be killed by a monster you will start again at
the healer with nothing, and you will need to go back to the various shops to
get more armor, weapons etc. You will retain knowledge of any spells that you
know before you were killed.

Occasionally monsters will drop money when they are killed. This money is
yours if you can get it without getting killed by the next monster that
appears. Simply type ""get"" followed by the quantity and type of coin, i.e.
""get 8 silver"". This money will come in handy when you want to buy better
weapons or spells.

Remember to check your experience and go to the trainer when you have enough
points to go up a level.

When you have reached level 3, you are ready to move on to Silvermere. Head
southwest and follow that trail until you reach the boatman. Type BORROW
SKIFF to row across the water to the new city. Once you have reached the far
dock, type MAP. This will show you a map of the city you are now in and where
everything is at. Move south to get to River Street. Explore around and start
finding new monsters to fight, like in the slums to the south. Join groups of
larger characters to get to places you normally couldn't and to go on quests.

enough--the gravedigger's simple but firm handwriting cataloguing burials,
and noting the occasional full moon and such...

""Silvermere Council has ordered excavation past the Marble Tomb. History
has said this place is to never be disturbed, but how little our own city
remembers this. I fear what it may bring.""

""Excavation is finished, and the undead have grown more restless. My charm
of protection seems to affect them less and less. Just last night, after 
burying some poor sod, a zombie approached me and almost took a swing at 
me, and then moved on. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or not, but I 
feel more ill is going to come of this."" 

[0;1;32m...Another page reads...[0;32m
""Today I had to beat off two zombies and a skeleton before finding solace 
in my shack. Must remember to go to the bishop or Sheriff and ask for 
aid.""

[0;1;32m...As you get close to the end of the diary, another page catches your 
eye...[0;32m
""Heavens forgive me... I know not what I have done. Last night, as I
was burying what was left of a dwarf who had met up with too many dire
wolves, a black-cloaked figure suddenly appeared out of thin air. He
smelled worse than any coffin I've ever had to dig up, and though I could
not see his face, I could somehow sense evil, and I felt a chill crawl   
over my body. The figure did not speak, and yet I heard a voice echoing
in my head... a voice that terrified me to my very bones... 'It will only
get worse before it gets better, mortal. A dark plague is coming to
consume this land. This has been foretold, but it appears that the
victorious seem to forget old debts. I offer you the chance to join the
side that is destined for victory, or I can end your living misery and
ensure that your bones never find rest.' Frozen with fear, I coulȽ'7532"

'Take this, as a token of your allegiance to me. It will cause the undead 
to ignore you, and only you. Remember me. I'm not through with you yet.' 
Then the figure vanished, leaving behind a black shovel covered in 
horrible runes. Though I tried to resist, the shovel seemed to find its 
way to my hand, and I felt my stomach twinge when I touched it. I did not 
dream well last night......""

[0;1;32m...Every page after this entry is barely legible...  You can only make out
a few words here and there...

He then adds ""Maybe it'd be good if you went to the bulletin or bishop and do some odd jobs for them, since we disapprove of lollygaggers around here."" Giving you a disdainful smile he strokes his proud grey beard.

had convinced the dwarven kingdom to allow strangers into their realm.  I was
then banished from Khazarad, and for political reasons I was also banished from
Silvermere.  After I had fled from my first [0;1;32mhome[0;32m, Silvermere was the only
other place where I felt accepted.""  With a sigh Kotar pulls a circular blade

in command over her troops.  My specialty was to organize the guerilla raiding
on the gnomes.  But soon a dark emissary started to visit the castle regularly,
and my assignments changed.  The queen ordered me to capture citizens from the
town of Silvermere.  I argued with her for hours, to rethink her plans.  It was
at that point that I knew she had gone insane with power.  That night I slipped
through the dank caverns of my home and never looked back.""

mine.  I discovered his misfortunes after leaving Silvermere.  We talked for
a great many hours.  I told him of the current news, and of my travels, and
he shared with me his misfortunes and studies.  To this day I still get
information for him in hopes to free him from his prison.  He repays me by
creating wards or little trinkets that I can use.  This blue tarp ,for instance
, was one of Dhelvanens gifts.  It not only keeps this room cool, but it hides
my location from the mother dragon who also inhabits this lair.""

from the nest and is greeted by my guards.  Which suits me fine, because
their hides are of great quality, and their mother makes many of them for me.""
Kotar breaks into a broad laugh, ""I do love perfecting my tailoring practice,
and I haven't found a better place to get materials.""  The end of his laugh
turns into an evil grin.  ""While Dhelvanen and I share a hatred for the creatures,
I am one of the few who can avenge him.""

Most of the cities were razed to the ground by Hellfire, their citizens slaughtered or driven into the surrounding countryside, forced to live in fearful squalor while the armies of the Dark One continued their destruction. The places the least affected by the War were the isolated cities-- Daerlon, Silvermere, Goldhome, and the like, as the Dark One concentrated his attacks upon the centers of strength from the outset, and even by the time the dark forces were finally repelled, they had not yet reached them. The forests of the Elves escaped wrath, of course, as their obscuring magics prevented the enemy from penetrating far into the wood. The Dwarves had but to shut their impenetrable iron doors and let the tides of Orcs pound themselves senseless against them. The Kang simply stayed in their swamps, as any evil force who entered had not only to battle the hostile swamp, but the
clever guerilla tactics of the Kang warriors. The other races,

Travelers from Khazarad to Silvermere were sometimes accosted by bandits on the Swampside Path but for the most part the Dwarven Guardsmen and Gnomish patrols kept the path safe. Above the Cliff however the story was much different. Traveling parties and even militia from Silvermere were being ambushed by hidden archers and groups of well armed thieves and 
rogues. The Kings Governor in the new city of Silvermere, one Humpfrey Lionheart by name, was well aware that this increased banditry threatened a major link between the newly formed Council of the Five Kingdoms and had sent daily couriers to Port Blackwater by way of the newly completed Western Road. Humpfrey was astounded to hear by way of a ""Kings Runner"" that the High King himself was coming to Silvermere. What the good Governor would soon learn was that the King was coming in force with his entire entourage and that the Kings 
Scriers had foreseen a great doom looming near Silvermere.

9419,0,0,"The arrival of the King in Silvermere was a cause for much celebration. Fires burned in the Town Square for several nights and long guarded supplies were brought out for great feasting. In the High Kings party was the son of the Governor, Godfrey, a sworn Holy Knight of the household guard, and a daughter of Kulgar, Ca'trine, sworn Holy Knight and treaty foster daughter to the King. 
Ca""trine chose to go in public by the name Doggie Doober, a childish corruption in the common tongue of the Dwarven phrase for ""eager worker"". The army accompanying the King, one thousand souls, but a small part of his forces, was a wonder in it's time. Mixed Races, mixed Classes, squads of stealthy 
scouts and companies of Half-Ogre Warriors, troops of Mages to bring down fire and troops of Priests to call down the wrath of the Gods. Healers, Singers, thinkers and seers, a thing put together never seen in the Realm before. The Kings entourage including his lovely Queen Brendan, his son and her two
daughters, as well as many servants and councilors were housed in the Government House overlooking the City Park. The King made his Headquarters above the Guild Hall and the army was quartered in the Park 
and in the Barracks of the City Towers.

The first foray of the forces of Albion was the dispatch through the hidden sally port in the sewers of a party of the most stealthy of the kings scouts, followed closely by a company of heavy infantry through the city gate. The scouts reported that the organized Thieves and Rogues withdrew to the north in the face of a deliberately noisy force. The King dispatched a company of light infantry along with magical support troops to reinforce the Half-Ogre force and the assembly followed a well worn path north from the road from a place near the peculiar Blue Tower of the merchant Jorah. Beating off nuisance attacks by goblin archers the force found it's way to a Huge Cave, the apparent source of the organized banditry. Hoisting torches and lanterns the Light Infantry led the way and swept aside  a determined but doomed guard of Goblins and fought deep into the barracks of Ogre Guards and Warriors where they took some unpleasantly severe losses.  Due to the narrow passages the brave Half-Orcs were unable to support each other and the heavier forces and magical support were unable to come quickly forward. Once the force was able to properly array itself they swept forward and cleared all the Cave of hostile forces. Or so they thought, for the Huge Cave has many hidden places.

Footsore and tired the force charged the entire route, through the Cave and the Forest, up the Forest Road and right through Silvermere without a pause. With the lightly armored Mystics, Rangers, Ninjas and Druids trotting in the lead they charged through the Western Door into the heart of the besieging Gnoll 
army. The Gnolls were thrown into disarray but the Kings forces once again suffered heavy losses in the most lightly armored of the troops. Kreegaks Gnolls, acting on orders of Lord Cambron mounted a quick counterattack but it was beaten off with only small losses amongst the Kings troops and the City Militia was able to close the Western Door and mount a solid defense over the now ruined workers quarters in the suburb.

After weeks of stalemate punctuated by increasingly savage assaults out of the Darkwood against the Gate and Eastern walls and accentuated by the silent siege of the Western Door pickets on the Dock defenses and guards on the Graveyard Bridge reported a large number of boats passing upstream singing the songs of Kagh-eh-Goru. They did not approach Silvermere but passed upstream and out of sight. None of the Militia or the Kings advisors knew what this might mean for as yet the forces of Goru-Nezar had not been identified as hostile, but as word filtered out some others took note. The King could not know that this was not the first move of Goru-Nezar but the second. The first move had been an assault on the Elven town in the Northern Forests. Using information supplied by his ally the Quickling Lord the forces of Goru-Nezar bypassed the Hill of Seeing and fell upon the Tower of Study, crushing it utterly. Unable to find the entry to the town hidden by
Elven magic the army eventually fell victim to the forces of the forest, at the end even the trees themselves joined the fight doing savage damage to the Ogre army. The curses of Goru-Nezar blighted parts of the Old Forest but could not save his tattered force. It was however an acceptable price to pay to keep the Elves out of the battle to come. Goru's hope rode with the success of the second force. It's purpose was to extinguish all hope of goodness and light in the world and as it progressed the clouds gathered and the sun could not
be seen.

In fact the region around Silvermere held many surprises for the King. Without warning the Gnoll siege from the Dragons Teeth Hills was broken from behind. A Sergeant Markus of the Royal Guards arrived escorted by a fierce band of fighters led by the Mage Morukai Soulscourge from the independent town of Rhudaur. Markus told the High King that word of the 
situation was already on the way to the Capitol in the hands of the one eyed Ranger Skarlock Rasthall and two Guardsmen from his post in the Black Mountains. Morukai requested a closed audience with the King and
emerged within the hour wearing the Kings Colors on his arm and the knot of Captain on his shoulder, his men also donned the Kings Colors and assembled themselves in a privately owned warehouse near the Docks. Less than a day later the siege of the Gate was broken by an even larger party emerging from the Mountains north of the Darkwood and led by the Bard Orfeo Talespinner. Orfeo also attended the King and emerged as a captain in the Kings Colors, He and his men joined the forces of Morukai near the Docks.

Ƚ'7532"
9424,0,0,"These developments caused much concern and whispering among the people of Silvermere and the men of the Kings army particularly when Godfrey Lionheart and a picked band of Paladins moved to the same warehouse under the Kings Orders. Within days the Ranger Skarlock led the lead elements of a relief column up the Western Road and the mood in Silvermere brightened perceptibly. In a few more days the Kings Army had grown to over four thousand souls. With all of this activity it comes as no surprise that the absence of Morukai, Orfeo and Godfrey went unnoticed for some time. Above the eastern Waterfall the forces of the Red Mage Goru-Nezar had smashed the surface fortifications of the Temple of the Phoenix and with brute force were digging into the many levels of the Catacombs beneath, driving the Templar Dorshar Lightblade and the Order of 
the Phoenix deeper and deeper into their final refuge. The losses taken by the Templars were terrible but each of them was bought dearly and the army of Goru-Nezar made it's progress at great cost. At the end, Dorshar and his fellow Templars stood defending the last passages outside the Grotto of the Phoenix 
when Morukai and Orfeo, using exotic mining tools of Gnomish invention, fell upon the forces of the Red Mage from behind, driving them to a frenzy and smashing them utterly. The last of them, Goru-Nezars own Necromancer died within reach of the Phoenix Egg, struck down By Dorshar Himself.

Tired and wounded, Dorshar knew his time as guardian of the Phoenix was past and seeing Godfrey in the party of his salvation recognized a younger kindred spirit. He passed his knowledge and authority to Godfrey and the few survivors of the Order of the Phoenix joined Godfreys Paladins in the new Order of Light. The fortifications of the Temple were beyond repair but by the employment of Gnomish specialists and tools the Catacombs were turned into an impassible maze and the old stone stairway beside the waterfall was cut away leaving no trace of where it had been. The secret of the only way to reach the Temple was now safely out
concealed in Kulgars Kingdom, far from the reach of the Red Mage.

Ƚ'7532"
9426,0,0,"Driven to mad desperation Goru-Nezar envisioned a final solution to isolate the Phoenix of Light in it's Temple by destroying Silvermere. He sent part of his force across the river to the Dragons Teeth Hills to attack Silvermere from the west while his main force marched down the Old Road to the Silver River to attack the Silvermere Docks. The forces of the Red Mage clashed briefly with Kreegaks Gnolls over the leadership of this assault but this was quickly put aside and the combined force advanced on the Western Road. Unfortunately the Kings scouts had heard the clash of arms reverberating through the hills and by the time the Gnolls and the forces of Goru-Nezar reached the Road the army of the King was waiting and the attack was smashed almost to the last man. A few survivors fled back to the hidden Gnoll camp but would never be in a
position to threaten the Realm again.

Practitioners of the Magic arts loyal to the King whipped the river to a froth beating back the massed attack to the Silvery Pool where the entire might of the King was launched against them. The next few days were terrible in the Ironwood, two great forces matched each other in the largest contest of arms ever seen in the Realm. Backward and forward the two great armies surged,
ravaging the once beautiful Old Road but step by step the forces of the King prevailed driving the Red Mage back. At the end Goru-Nezar fell back into his city behind his well maintained walls and fortifications. The Kings army stood upon the ruins of the Ogre Camp in front of the city gates. The Red Mage would ask for no quarter and it is unlikely that the King would grant any so the siege was mounted and went on for weeks. Great engines battered at the walls and the forces of magic were employed by both sides, the carnage was
terrible. Then, when Goru-Nezar was concentrating his energies upon the King, with a single great crash it was over. With the turning of a card in a monastery far away Annora called down the power of the Gods, Goru-Nezar and his army destroyed, his city crushed.

gathered his battered army for the return to Silvermere. On the slow and painful march back down the Ravaged Path the King was met by a messenger bringing news of yet another foul blow in Silvermere. A raiding party
had struck secretly within the walls. The Queen lay in the Temple severely wounded, the Government house was sacked, much of the Household Guard was dead and the Kings Children stolen away.

9429,0,0,"The King rushed on ahead of his army with only a small guard and at the Silvery Pool was met by another messenger. The Ranger Skarlock had led the troops of Orfeo and Morukai as well as Doggie Doober and the survivors of the Household Guard into the southern suburb and into caverns they had discovered beneath the
house of a recently founded Cult. No word had come back from them for several days and no traces of them had been found by the few brave Militiamen who had returned from the search. The Kings return to Silvermere was a gloomy one. The city was in good condition , the defenses were once again strongly manned but few smiles were to be seen on the streets. Scouts reported no hostile activity East or West, North or South, but the pall of dread that hung over the City was paralyzing.

After about a week Silvermere was rocked by a slight tremor in the earth and smoke was seen to rise from Cult House tinting it black. None of the Kings scriers could tell what it meant other than that there were great
forces involved.

but with the help of the lizard folk the surviving raiders carried their captives away into a maze of strange Crystalline Passages. The hunters followed and in a strange twist of fortune emerged at a Dreary Village
ahead of their prey. Waiting in ambush Skarlock, Morukai, Orfeo and Doggie fell upon the raiders, killing them to a man and freed the children. Doggie ordered the Household Guard to return to Silvermere with the Prince and Princesses while she went with the others to discover the source of this outrage.

It was clear that a party this size could not force the gate. Then Skarlock did a remarkable thing, removing the eyepatch from above his scarred left cheek he revealed a glittering crystal orb set into his ruined eye socket. He stood studying the Black Fortress with this magic eye for several minutes then returned the eyepatch and led the party south into the seemingly impassible fields and to a path that led to a secret side door to the Fortress. By stealth, guile and a certain charm they defeated the defenders in these shadowy passages and slew the triumvirate of Dark Lords, each in their own offices.

Ƚ'7532"
9432,0,0,"In a concealed Dark Temple they found the force behind all the mischief that had bedeviled Silvermere, Lord Cambron, The Champion of Blood. Rallying all their resources the party fell upon Cambron and in a fierce battle defeated him only to discover that he was but a husk occupied by the Hellion, perhaps the Blood God himself. Fighting now in quiet desperation the party used all of their skills and talents but many of their followers perished in the horrid blasts of the combat. In the end it was the good Doggie Doober that struck 
the mortal blow, the Hellion vanished in a blast of energy that was the source of the tremors felt in Silvermere. When the Household Guard emerged with the children there was much rejoicing in Silvermere and when Skarlock, Morukai, Orfeo and Doggie returned with their surviving troops they were feted and feasted around the town. In thanks, the King proclaimed Silvermere a free town, exempt from royal taxes and free to elect their own leadership to replace the aging Humpfrey. He asked only for the loyalty of the city in return for his 
own loyalty. ""After all"" he said, ""Silvermere needs no King to defend it when it has citizens such as these."" The King returned to his Capitol across the Sea taking with him Dorshar, Doggie and the Governor Humpfrey but
many of his troops retired in Silvermere, doing much to improve the quality of the Militia and it's training. Markus returned to the Black Mountains with a captains knot on his shoulder. After a time the City became once again a backwater where nothing of much importance ever happened and eventually the Western Road fell into disrepair and was blocked by rockfall and avalanche cutting the City off from the rest of the Kingdom. The Barricade on the Forest Road would be removed opening the way once again to the East. But Silvermere would always be known as a place where great things HAD happened and the legends live on.......

Many years ago there was a great and mighty witchunter, of the cat-race. He became the biggest and brightest Crimson Flame to shine in many ages. Fearless was he in the slaying of the great and many demon-sent magi that roamed the earth, as well as fending off soulless demons that threatened our realm, as they first did on that black day in Jurard. This is the sad tale of his last days. Many times he was found to travel in the valley of Arlysia, known for the famous library which kept any book it found to be sacred and treasured. Peace was well known through the valley, and what monsters he found were vanquished by his quick use of the blade, which was forged for him by the finest smiths
of the Order. One day a great and malevolent kai demon using the name Enigma Lord fell upon the valley with great and sudden ferocity, using his black arts he scorched many farms and slain any who would lie in his wake. Refuges of his wrath by the hundreds fled into the town many counts of the deadly force with which the motherless mystic did use to kill any who he saw. Brandishing his great blade Draka begin his hunt for the fiend, going to all corners of the valley until he found him deep in the heart of the Blackwood Forest. The kai one quaked and shook from the raw and righteous fury which had consumed Draka.
""Bow now for your purification!"" Draka did say. Black was the cackle that left the lips of the Enigma and he spit upon the feet of Draka. Vengeful and furious did Draka become and he struck at the Engima Lord, his blade shining in the afternoon sun. Fearful was the mystic, for he could see his death in the blade of the inquisitor, even so he dodged many of the swings from Draka, and counter attacked with swift punches, and kicks. The battle waged all through the forest, the mystic fleeing like Ƚ'7532"

So mighty was the blow that the lord was thrown into the lake, turning it crimson with his last drops of blood. Draka, himself heavily wounded did return to the township, where he was greeted by great any many cheers. Delirious from the pain he did accept the kindness of a shawled old woman, who gave him water. Drank it did he, and only realizing as the last drop hit his tongue that it was poison which he consumed. Gazed did Draka at the Engima Lord who was the cowled old woman, using darkest treachery to have his revenge upon the inquisitor. With the last strength of his hand, Draka swung his mighty blade, cleaving the head of the Enigma, before
himself dying from the poison which he had unknowingly drank.

The prophecy is not a plague in the physical sense, but of the spiritual sense. 
Only the most soulless or hellbent would ever consider undertaking, but history has proven some individuals as that do walk this realm and desire the power held within. The prophecy is gotten by a process evil and filled with dark ceremonies. Essentially it is the process of turning one into a being of undeath, but with greater power, and a constant thirst for the souls of others. What is required is a jewel of great size and value, this is most essential for it shall hold the life force of the being. Next is a chain of great worth, which shall link the soul of that being to the jewel which shall contain it. Next is the heart of a magical and evil beast, with many atrocities committed 
by it, for it is the power of this beast which is used in the transformation to undead. The greater the evil, the more power brought by the transformation. Take these items into a black and lightless cavern of stone, and construct a great portal made from the bones of innocent men slain by their own tools. I refuse to copy the words used within the vile ceremony, for they are filled with evil and may corrupt both the scribe and reader of this work. Reader I forbid you to look for these phrases Ƚ'7532"
9437,1,0,"for they will be the damnation of you. What is known once the ceremony is complete is unknown, for you must use the phrases and enter the portal of bone. Once through that it is written that the subject shall under go immense pain, once this is done the living body shall be loosed, and an undead creature will come to pass. The Plague is then begun. So great is the power of this creature that it can consume the souls of many with a wave of its hand, with blackest necromancy it can destroy all the living in the realm, making undead subjects of any who oppose it.  The Plague must never happen, and should you be a tool towards that end, reader, I curse you to the farthest ends of Hell.

Valion was never seen again, and a week after his passing the lake of Arlysia turned into blood, and it began to rain for a month, as if the heavens cried for the lost hero.""

sandstone did he make the decision to delve further into the mountainside.
Long did the slaves labour under the burning sun to carve out more stone
blocks for the pharaoh's pyramid, and many perished under the cruel whips of
the overseers. Winding tunnels had pierced the quarry walls, delving deep
into the rock, when they came upon the ore.

Blood-red it was, and harder than steel. When the overseers first reported
the metal to the pharaoh, he immediately was overcome with lustful images of
his armies wielding strong new weapons. He doubled the number of slaves, and
set them to mining this new ore. So great was his want for the strange metal,
that thousands died and were dragged outside for the carrion-birds to devour.
Tensions rose as even the strongest slaves began to weaken from malnutrition
and abuse. Finally, one day, as the pharaoh was personally overseeing the
mining operation, an angry slave picked up a jagged chunk of the red iron ore
and flung it at the pharaoh.

What happened next was a shock to everyone. All knew that the pharaoh was a
mighty wizard, and many had perished while attempting to slay him. Normal
weaponry simply would not harm him, as he was cloaked in a magical barrier.
However, when the chunk of red ore struck the pharaoh in the head, he reeled
backward, blood dripping from a deep cut. For what seemed like an eternity,
all froze in shock and horror. Then, suddenly, incredulous that he had been
harmed by a mere slave, the pharaoh unleashed a storm of flame upon the slave
that incinerated him on the spot. Their daze broken by the magical destruction of their comrade, the other slaves immediately began stoning the pharaoh with shards of the red ore.

In a bloody fury, the pharaoh called upon his immense magical powers. Demonic
magic swirled about the chamber, causing all who viewed it to stop what they
Ƚ'7532"
9440,1,0,"were doing and quiver in terror. With a triumphant, bloodthirsty cry, the
pharaoh completed his spell, and vanished.

For a moment all thought he had simply left. Abruptly, however, a rumbling
far beneath the earth rocked everyone off of their feet. The rock at the far
end of the chamber split open with great violence, revealing a hideous dark
abomination! The pharaoh, in his indignant hatred, had summoned a nether
beast to devour all who remained in the mine.

It is at this point that I turned and ran for my life. The sound of horrified
slaves and overseers being devoured will haunt me for the rest of my life.
Once a cruel overseer, I now am a simple monk who lives in penitence for my
former crimes. Perhaps I was the only one who survived to tell this tale.
May God have mercy on their souls.""

You quietly inform the Grey Lord of your travels to Arlysia, contact with the ancient gypsy, and eventual knowledge gained from Maxmillion concerning the prophecy which Zanthus prepared. He takes all of this in with his same impassive stare, showing nothing of emotion. Finally you speak of your failed attempt at destroying the newly created Lich. You note with some distress the slight frown that approaches on the neutral one, before it quickly vanishes.

Finally his voice is heard in your mind,

<Indeed your effort is commendable, however the results are less then ideal. 
It would seem our forces are at their most weakest while this darkness gains more in power and might. Though he surely must rest to have fashioned this portal into a Shadow World, but all too soon he shall surely come forth again with the forces of this blackest prophecy in his grasp.>

through the white oak woods like a blast of cold wind. He was a magnificent beast, full of vigor and strength, but it was also vain. The seed of envy ate at him, for he was jealous of the doe and deer that reside in the forest there. Soon evil pierced his soul and he was banished from the forest, as is anyone
who is not of a goodly heart. He was thrown to the blackwood forest where he was devoured by the wilderness there. The night after he was resurrected by a dark power, corrupted into something hideous and evil. Unfortunately pilgrims of Dawnstar were passing through and were slaughtered by the unicorn, all

The great race of the Orcs started long ago, in a time before times, when the 
darkness had yet to be challenged by the light. Already had the footsteps of 
the Sylva and the Khaz been laid upon the soft earth, but a strange set of new 
races had risen, one promising race among them stood and called itself Human. 
It is not known however by any mortal on this plane where these wanderers came 
from, but their talents to adapt to change seemed endless, and for this reason 
they were frowned upon by the stalwart Sylva and the rugged Khaz. As time past 
the races seemed to forge an uncomfortable peace, but one dark day a strange 
orb struck the small town of Cenlus and from the ashes walked the single 
demonic visage of the first Orc. He was tall, maybe six feet, but seemed to be 
built to be everything that the Sylva was not. The balance had begun. The light 
that banished the darkness of innocence had been challenged by the first true 
evil. More and more of this powerful race appeared over time, though from what 
I can tell no women had been seen. For a while I forget this great race, but 
when in the tower of Jurard writing a speech for the namesake king of that 
great country a strange man entered. He was cloaked in a great green and 
black cloak, and he obviously wore layers of animal skins beneath it, as I 
could see from the part in his cloak. His face was shrouded save those 
burning eyes, those same eyes I saw when scrying, so long ago, rising 
from the ashes of Cenlus. I know not what he said that day as his language 
was strange to me, but I quickly wrote it down with his supervision:
""Dark was that day, formed from the ashes of myself, I became dark. The 
mage, my father showed me his dark secret. I could not contain his great 
power, it caught me off guard and it split my infernal body into the dark 
and the light, the sparkle and the sword. I know not why I was saved, but 
Ƚ'7532"
9533,1,0,"rage stole my body and I ripped my other half to pieces before my master's 
eyes. My sin will never be forgiven, he cursed me to know with the spark of 
the light what I had done, and in rage I tried to join my other half in the 
blood. My master would not let me, cursed to live forever in darkness with 
the spark to know what I am! The orb of magic that split me destroyed a 
small town, transformed it to what you now call wasteland, beyond the south. 
My body twisted, leaving me torn, the light of Sylva gone the dark of Orc now. 
I have no need to hurt any longer but in defense, I saw your scry upon me it'
s eye burning me, today I have found you."" 
Afterwards he looked at me with a saddened face and threw back his hood, and I 
beheld an angel before me, this beast which spawned the Horde had become a 
golden child. He stood erect and placed his hand over my eyes and my body raged 
with power, when I awakened I could not see. I write this now with the aid of 
my son Morukai, I am told he was born with gifts not known to any before him, 
the Great One, the Orc still aids me now through my son, I only hope he can 
save us from what the scry has told.
As you finish reading the passage there is a small elegant note at the bottom 
written in blue ink:
My father was an excellent teacher to me as a scribe, and my awakened power is 
due to his inquisition I have no doubt, however he never was given the chance 
to translate the speech of the Orc, I have done what I can to. A and E seem 
to be spoken and written as Ai. C is replaced by Cs, K by a Ch, O by a U, 
U by a Uo, W by a Ou, S by C, and it seems an H is added after many letter, 
however I have more pressing matters to worry of this, I have seen his mind and 
know it well.

While I still am researching I have determined the resident within is the source of all our troubles,  the island became this almost a year ago, after the disappearance of he who was called Valion Darkbane. Events seem to unfold that show the one called Zanthus is about to return, and the prophecy of plague is about to occur, most likely at the same time."" Without warning the cloud explodes with a loud flash, the stench of death is thick in the air. You can tell the woman did not expect this as she rubs her hands in silent agony. ""It would seem my crying has been caught by our watery neighbor, it is of no matter."" She continues with her tale, ""I was but a young giorvan when Zanthus himself was banished, but I clearly remember the events there after, one who was called Helvectus, a young farmer's boy at the time, but it became very clear that Zanthus had dug his claws into that boys soul."" The ancient shakes her head sadly, ""Helvectus followed in his master's footsteps and learned all he could when it came to death and dark arts. He joined the library and became known to have strange habits, which eventually lead to his banishment."" Her face seems to drift off into a vision of long ago, but she quickly recovers.

9686,0,0,"Long ago in a forgotten land, there was a Dwarf Paladin, who aspired to
become godlike. Were he pious enough he would realized his foolishness,
but he was stubborn, and blind to the ways of divinity.

His journey began in the town of Silvermere where he was befriended by a
Dark-elven Bard, and a Dwarf Paladin like himself, who believed he had
the power of a god already, but that is another story.

Joined into the House of Lords did our hero do, and on many adventures 
did he go. On a particular adventure the House determined to ransack the 
dark cave of the goblins, drawing straws it was determined that our hero 
would be the pack mule, and so he has forced to bear the weight of hordes 
of copper and silver thereafter. So great was the weight upon his 
shoulders be likened himself to a mighty bull, carrying anything upon his 
broad shoulders. However the strain was so much that it weighed upon his 
brain as well.

On one such excursion he was struck with delirium, and soon began to Moo 
to all he saw, and went into a berserking rage, slaying all the goblins 
they encountered, who were in fits of confusion by this Mooing madman.

So enraged was he that a nearby torch set fire to him, and he did not
notice it, so insane had he become. Through some form of luck he and his
companions made it out alive, carrying out easily two thousand gold a 
piece from their raid.

As they shared drinks at the Homely Hearth his friends determined from 
that point onward he would be known as the Flaming Cow God of DOOM. For 
he carried a bull's share, had lived through flame, and brought doom 
upon all he saw.

This pleased him for he believed this proved he was destined for divinity,
he would find out how mortal he was, but that is another story....

9687,0,0,"The Summarized Theories of Dark Distortion - 
By the Great Zanthusonius
Though many before have futile tried to write the theory thus far of the Dark Distortion, I Zanthusonius shall take it upon myself to write the collection with a more knowledgeable and delicate hand. And so I begin reader take heed, no
one can be more brilliant in their writings then me.

The Dark Distortion is more or less derived from another theory concerning the universe existing in several instances. Each instance being of it's own independent system then those others that exist with it. Many speculations indicate that one could possibly even go between instances, seeing each one
with each course changed. Other speculations indicate that planar existences
can also be used to traverse these great voids between instances of different
multiversal situations. With that said the Dark Distortion was developed with by the thinking of the most enlightened Helvectus, who determined that in these various instances that for each single reality there is a distorted one, purely
corrupted by the powers of supreme evil. Further he has scribed in his previous
writings that those dark distortions ultimately connect with that instance of
reality for which it is distorted by, and if that connection were brought about
by focused energy through a single body, he would reap rewards from both worlds.
Rumour spreads that this Helvectus attempted many times to create such connections between twisted and untwisted worlds, how ever since his abrupt
Ƚ'7532"
9687,1,0,"vanishing 100 years ago no one else has attempted duplication of this theory, or no one that has survived at least. Moving forward, the basics are that most things evil in the uncorrupted instance are even more so in the distorted one, while things that may be of pure or balanced mind have some taint on them, significant or no, nothing is virginal in this dark reality. Many writings indicate that religious writings that describe end time cataclysm's actually refer to this event of merging where the pure and vile become as one, obliterating both in the process. With the many elements of planar travel that occur this is most likely not due to occur, simply because of low risk odds 
that enough power could be gathered as a source to manifest such a polyversal event. I shall continue with this in other writings as my research of Helvectus continues on ward.

an age of prosperity for all. Unfortunately, this could not last; prophecies,
long since forgotten, predicted that the power balance would change, and change
it did. 

""Rhudar was a bustling town full of economic wealth during the Age of
Prosperity and its population was rapidly growing to rival Silvermere's.
Its temple, perceived by the realm to be honoring the codes and treaties
of the time, taught the ancient rituals of magick to any willing and devout
adventurer who applied. This alone helped increased the popularity of the
city. Unbeknownst to all, a calculated and growing evil was festering
within. The Grandmaster of the Shadow Fist Temple had grown more than
weary of his limited powers.""

""Whether the matter is understandable as mere lust for power, or the
Grandmaster truly failed to appreciate that balance leads to prosperity,
is academic. Thus began the end of the Age of Prosperity and the
transformation of the Shadow Fist Temple to an evil brotherhood possessed by greed, lust for power and ultimate domination of the realm.

""Working with a malefic diligence, the Grandmaster ordered the brotherhood
to cull ancient documents and knowledge of dark magick from the realm. No one
suspected his motives and no request for long-forgotten scrolls was
denied. It is the nature of evil to take simple agreement for weakness and it made the Grandmaster impudently proud of the mass of information gathered by
his minions. He began to train a warrior to carry out his imminent conquering

""While the haughty Grandmaster assumed his actions went ignored, one man
in the realm felt the tipping of the balance scale. Dorshar Lightblade, a
human and a witchhunter by profession, may have been the most balanced soul to
have ever existed in the realm. It was the Phoenix, Bel-Lai, the embodiment of
divine equilibrium, which selected Dorshar, and which instructed and
charged him to devote his life and energies to a golden mean of balance. Neither
side in the struggle for good and evil should gain too much power.
Domination by one side or the other would lead to destruction of the realm. Neither good nor evil could exist truly without the other.

""Dorshar worked quietly, remaining a passive observer, mindful that his
own interfering within the realm might be as disruptive of balance as any
overt attempt of good or evil. When he discovered the scheme of the Grandmaster
and informed the Phoenix, immediate action was necessary.

""Battles raged for years, yet the Grandmaster's strength increased.
Dorshar, aligned with the unprepared followers of good, valiantly resisted. Then, at the darkest moment, the Dark One's Avatar moved to gain control of the 
Phoenix herself, to obtain ultimate power for the Grandmaster. Dorshar led 
the Templars of the Golden Light, a holy order sworn to protect the
Phoenix, against the seemingly unstoppable Avatar. Tragically, it appeared to all that the Grandmaster would succeed in his corrupted plans.""

""Bel-Lai had not though, existed for eons without learning a trick or two
herself. The Phoenix determined that avoiding the destruction of the
realm, even at the cost of her own liberty warranted sacrifice. She entreated
Morukai, a mage of legendary renown, to imprison her in a manner to keep
her from the clutches of the Grandmaster. Although this was accomplished
successfully and the Grandmaster was stopped in his quest for ultimate

day, the scales of good and evil tip precariously back and forth with new
threats to it constantly. Only the actions of new adventurers will
determine what fate has in store for the realm.""

for it was the rule of the House of Lords that any Dark Blade who fell a member of the House would meet with swift and vicious justice. The war between the House and the Blades had carried on for far too long, and Dougan meant to set an example of his slaying by Rugal that would leave no doubt in the minds of those in the land how vicious a mad dwarf could be. So great was the guile and
cunning of Rugal that he lead false trails through the crystal caverns, herding
monsters with his cruelty to lay in wait for the crazed paladin. This did little to slow Dougan however and they finally encountered each other nearby a Kher grass field. 
The rage within the paladin had built to massive amounts that he flailed wildly with his greataxe, finding great chunks of reptilian scale to carve from the witchunter. Practically defenseless Rugal could not fight back against the enraged one. With each block of his cutlass, the axe would brutally swipe it away, for every cleave by the dwarf, the kang stumbled farther back, gaining another severe wound. Finally Rugal in desperation fled through the grass and stumbled to the ground, with unheard of agility he rolled further on
his scaled belly through the dirt, losing the angry paladin who was still charging straight ahead.

Dougan, much more powerful with his experience in travels, besieged Rugal with renewed fury. Within mere seconds the villian Rugal was beheaded, a corpse with his blood forming a large black pool. With great glee the dwarf began to chop and mince the corpse into smaller and smaller pieces, he then fed the many pieces to the giant snakes below, thus showing the brutality of the House of Lords.

I am but the simple innkeeper of the Dancing Dragon outside Arlysia, a crazed man garbed in gypsy leathers stumbled upon my doorstep not too long ago, this night was already considered a bad omen due to the great storm that came already upon this night. He babbled constantly, speaking of his fear of 
an evil hag who was coming for him, begging and pleading to provide him shelter.
We were not so far from the Arlysia gates so I was tempted to send him there but something in me decided against it. I wish I had not. 
Shortly a large gathering of gypsy dogs appeared, one indeed lead by an old woman, with a dark gleam in her eye. They all wielded wicked weapons of torture, each one looking more menacing then the next. They  stood outside and I came out to meet them, the elderly demanded I turn over the babbler to them, that there work was not finished. Mustering what courage I could I denied them, telling them whatever wretched deeds they wished I would not be party to. She warned me that he was a banished one from their tribe, and I would regret my decision. Again I declined, and like a breeze of wind they all vanished. 
With the help of my serving wenches and various patrons we all did what we could to soothe the babbler, nothing seemed to work and we gave him an upstairs room to die in. As the morning sun came up, so did he, brighter spirits then before. He gave no thanks and merely said he would return eventually and give me something proper for one such as me. Had I known how sinister those words were I would have gutted him there. He too vanished and was forgotten.

Grabbing the nearest chair I attacked him but with a sudden few flashes I was suddenly on the floor, holding my severed arm. He cackled and spit at me, calling me a dog, telling me how a fool I was to aid him when he was weak, for now he was strong and he would destroy all who had known him. What happened next I can not say but it is what now brings the scratching and howling to my door. Speaking in words that sounded vile and twisted the banished babbler moved his hands intricately and suddenly spoke in a booming voice, at the stroke of midnight my wonderful Inn would be besieged by bastardly little gremlins. And so now here I am, locked away in my room, spending my...

9697,0,0,"There once was a great scholar and scribe, known by no name but stranger. As far as anyone remembers, he always existed. For a time he wandered the library reading books, stories, scrolls, and conversin with those that made record. His time here was short however, his desire for truth, and knowledge drove him from this place of fancyful writing. Some small notes are all of him that exists. Here I have quoted several of distinct interest to me:

    ""It was written once in a book of lore that the Dark One conjured his avatar. However over time this fact was twisted by scholar and Loremaster alike, until only the great mage Morukai knew the truth of the avatar's being. Many have confused him with the great demon Goru-Nezar.""
    
I am unsure on this record, from my small childhood I was told of a great avatar who walked among us still, I am forbidden to leave these halls, or I would converse with the great one myself, for only he knows the true story, and only he would see through the lies.

    ""Several of man's years have past since the chieftain Kreegak became known, and his band of gnolls. Since that time many were fooled into believing that at one time they had been a great army, rather then the scum they are. Kreegak has been slain many times, but his lord and master Cambron of Blood has summoned his rotted corpse to life and he still lives among those wicked teeth, awaiting the final command.""
    
Of this I am sure, Lord Cambron's puppet Kreegak's soul is no longer on this plane, for our scribes could detect it, but a hole was ripped in those dreaded hills some time ago, a red stain upon the world. Perhaps by some twist of horror he still lives, cold and devoid of his soul, awaiting the order from the Lord of Blood.

Ƚ'7532"
9697,1,0,"    ""The story of the great human city is a sad one, the king, Yeshuz was obsessed with power, and sought any method under the gods to become one with power itself. Zorastra betrayed him, of this I am sure, by accident, or pure vileness, she betrayed him. When the portal was summoned Goru-Nezar, the demonic necromancer from beyond this world was summoned to this plane. He and his minions ravished poor Jurard.""
    
All our scribes have seen the ancient tome written by Kale, our greatest fears have been forged true by the stranger, perhaps the Goru was not the great Avatar after all, perhaps they are all wrong. Could the fabled city of Jurard truly be that forsaken place? No, it couldn't be, that would change everything indeed.

    ""It is thought that when Thrag sealed the barrier no one could break it, it was long after the war of the plague that that giant sealed the road, so that his orcs could fulfill Thrag's father's, Thurath's request for the orcs, goblins, and all the foul things that still remained to destroy Silvermere, to shut them off, and devour them as they sleep. The dwarves of Khazarad fell the barrier with gnomish powder, and Thrag was defeated before he could strike, perhaps we should rejoice, in the name of Kulgar, son of Kulthrek, Lord of the Dwarves I rejoice! HI HO!""
    
At times it strikes me that the stranger mumbled so, perhaps he had lost his mind, or perhaps he had never found it. I can stand and be counted however, as this scroll did not fall on dead eyes, even now Thrag has been joined by a fierce band of orcs, lead by a great Warlord who is nameless by all accounts, though he uses a weapon of the Dark One, a stealer of the life force of any who touches it.

Evil can no enter these halls even now we await a great scribe who shall lead us all to seek the past, the present, and it is said, the future.
