They are called the Dragon's Teeth because their sheer faces are extremely jagged, and are streaked through with deep red metallic veins-- making them appear as if they are dripping blood. Many an adventurer has tried to scale them, but to no avail. Strange and deadly creatures are known to stalk these hills, further adding to their shadowy reputation."}
{"id":1668973043,"text":"These lofty mountains are a wondrous balance between the beautiful and the deadly-- their twisting, razor-sharp spires reach elegantly towards the sky, but they mean certain death to anyone foolish enough to attempt scaling them.

An ankh hangs above a mantled, stone fireplace, surrounded on each side by portraits of a humble looking man and woman.
